  abstract={In this paper, we present a random puncturing analysis of low-density parity-check (LDPC) code ensembles. We derive a simple analytic expression for the iterative belief propagation (BP) decoding threshold of a randomly punctured LDPC code ensemble on the binary erasure channel (BEC) and show that, with respect to the BP threshold, the strength and suitability of an LDPC code ensemble for random puncturing is completely determined by a single constant that depends only on the rate and the BP threshold of the mother code ensemble. We then provide an efficient way to accurately predict BP thresholds of randomly punctured LDPC code ensembles on the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise channel (BI-AWGNC), given only the BP threshold of the mother code ensemble on the BEC and the design rate, and we show how the prediction can be improved with knowledge of the BI-AWGNC threshold. We also perform an asymptotic minimum distance analysis of randomly punctured code ensembles and present simulation results that confirm the robust decoding performance promised by the asymptotic results. Protograph-based LDPC block code and spatially coupled LDPC code ensembles are used throughout as examples to demonstrate the results.},

  year={2014},
  volume={62},
  number={10},
  pages={2469--2479},
  publisher={IEEE},
  abstract={Low density parity-check (LDPC) codes, are widely used for error correction in digital communication systems. Their inclusion in communication standards requires to define decoders able to support efficiently a set of codes with different code length, code rates or code structures. In addition to this high flexibility, these decoders still have to achieve high throughputs in order to comply with standards requirements. In this paper, we propose to address the problem of designing generic and efficient LDPC decoders by using a nonsymmetric NISC-based architecture that performs layered decoding. NISC architectures provide flexibility with a limited loss in hardware efficiency. In addition, an automated design flow is used to efficiently assign computations to the processing units (PU) and to map data to the memory units (MU). Unlike previous works, the NISC decoder can include a number of PUs that is different than the number of MUs. This nonsymmetric characteristic provides a higher degree of freedom during the computation/data assignment phase of the design flow. This whole design framework automatically generates an LDPC decoder able to support any set of predetermined LDPC codes regardless of their parameters. The automated nature of the design framework enables to easily explore the design space for a given set of codes. Compared to state of the art LDPC decoders, the automatically generated decoders achieve higher hardware efficiency even for the challenging-to-implement unstructured LDPC codes.},

  abstract={Channel coding may be viewed as the best-informed and most potent component of cellular communication systems, which is used for correcting the transmission errors inflicted by noise, interference, and fading. The powerful turbo code was selected to provide channel coding for mobile broad band data in the 3G UMTS and 4G long term evolution cellular systems. However, the 3GPP standardization group has recently debated whether it should be replaced by low density parity check (LDPC) or polar codes in 5G new radio, ultimately reaching the decision to adopt the LDPC code family for enhanced mobile broad band (eMBB) data and polar codes for eMBB control. This paper summarizes the factors that influenced this debate, with a particular focus on the application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementation of the decoders of these three codes. We show that the overall implementation complexity of turbo, LDPC, and polar decoders depends on numerous other factors beyond their computational complexity. More specifically, we compare the throughput, error correction capability, flexibility, area efficiency, and energy efficiency of ASIC implementations drawn from 110 papers and use the results for characterizing the advantages and disadvantages of these three codes as well as for avoiding pitfalls and for providing design guidelines.},

  abstract={An ultrahigh throughput low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoder with an unrolled full-parallel architecture is proposed, which achieves the highest decoding throughput compared to previously reported LDPC decoders in the literature. The decoder benefits from a serial message-transfer approach between the decoding stages to alleviate the well-known routing congestion problem in parallel LDPC decoders. Furthermore, a finite-alphabet message passing algorithm is employed to replace the VN update rule of the standard min-sum (MS) decoder with lookup tables, which are designed in a way that maximizes the mutual information between decoding messages. The proposed algorithm results in an architecture with reduced bit-width messages, leading to a significantly higher decoding throughput and to a lower area compared to an MS decoder when serial message transfer is used. The architecture is placed and routed for the standard MS reference decoder and for the proposed finite-alphabet decoder using a custom pseudo-hierarchical backend design strategy to further alleviate routing congestions and to handle the large design. Postlayout results show that the finite-alphabet decoder with the serial message-transfer architecture achieves a throughput as large as 588 Gb/s with an area of 16.2 mm2 and dissipates an average power of 22.7 pJ per decoded bit in a 28-nm fully depleted silicon on isulator library. Compared to the reference MS decoder, this corresponds to 3.1 times smaller area and 2 times better energy efficiency.},

In this paper, we present a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of the LDPC decoder using High-Level Synthesis (HLS). Because HLS can synthesize a hardware implementation from a high-level description, it is very effective in reducing design time, and in exploring various design alternatives. One of the biggest advantages of FPGAs is flexibility, and therefore, HLS for FPGAs is widely adopted as a good hardware synthesis method. In this paper, we describe an LDPC decoder in high level language, and a HLS tool called SDSoC is used to synthesize the decoder. The proposed design is a serial LDPC decoder that requires smaller amount on hardware resource and power consumption than the conventional design. The major drawback of a serial decoder is slow speed. To overcome such drawback, optimization techniques such as array partitioning, loop unrolling, pipelining methods and fixed-point conversion are applied. With the application of these techniques, the decoding speed of the proposed implementation is 8.11 times and 2.79 times faster than that of a non-optimized implementation and that of a software-based LDPC decoder, respectively.},

However, LDPC decoding is computationally intensive and the implementation of it on software in a parallel way is quite challenging due to the characteristics of LDPC decoding and structures of software. In this paper, we presented an efficient software implementation of the LDPC decoder using the Parallel Code Block Decoding mode for the WiMAX SDR base band system on IBM CELL Broadband Engine (BE). With a single Synergistic Processor Element (SPE) running at 3.2GHz, the implemented LDPC decoder can achieve a throughput up to 1.71 Mbps. With eight SPEs working in parallel, the decoder can obtain the throughput more than 13Mbps, which can meet the WiMAX system requirement at 5MHz bandwidth mode.},

  pages={84--90},
  abstract={A variety of factors is making it increasingly difficult and expensive to design and manufacture traditional Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). This has started a significant move towards the use of programmable solutions of various forms - increasingly referred to as programmable platforms. For the platform manufacturer, programmability provides higher volume to amortize design and manufacturing costs, as the same platform can be used over multiple related applications, as well as over generations of an application. For the application implementer, programmability provides a lower risk and shorter time-to-market implementation path. The flexibility provided by programmability comes with a performance and power overhead. This can be significantly mitigated by using application specific platforms, also referred to as Application Specific Instruction Set Processors (ASIPS). This paper details the reasons for this significant change in application implementation philosophy, provides illustrative contemporary evidence of this change, examines the space of application specific platforms, outlines fundamental problems in their development, and finally presents a methodology to deal with this changing design style.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. ASIP is application specific instruction-set processor dedicated designed for an application domain. ASIP instruction set is specifically designed to accelerate heavy and most used functions. ASIP architecture is designed to implement the assembly instruction set with minimum hardware cost. ASIP DSP is an application specific digital signal processor for iterative data manipulation and transformation extensive applications. General-purpose processor designers think of both the maximum performance and maximum flexibility. The instruction set must be general enough to support general applications. The compiler should offer compilation for all programs and to adapt all programmers' coding behaviors. ASIP designers have to think about applications and cost first. Usually the biggest challenges for ASIP designers are the silicon cost and power consumption. Based on the carefully specified function coverage, the goal of an ASIP design is to reach the highest performance over silicon, over power consumption, as well over the design cost. The requirement on flexibility should be sufficient instead of ultimate. The performance is application specific instead of the highest one. In this tutorial, ASIP, application specific instruction set processor, will be introduced and discussed for audience who want to know ASIP yet not want to design it. The introduction includes ASIP design flow, source code profiling, architecture exploration, assembly instruction set design, design of assembly language programming toolchain, firmware design, benchmarking, and micro architecture design. Two examples, design for instruction set level acceleration of radio baseband, and design for instruction set level acceleration of image and video signal processing, will be introduced.

  abstract={This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of nonbinary low-density parity check (LDPC) codes built out of protographs. We consider both random and constrained edge-weight labeling, and refer to the former as the unconstrained nonbinary protograph-based LDPC codes (U-NBPB codes) and to the latter as the constrained nonbinary protograph-based LDPC codes (C-NBPB codes). Equipped with combinatorial definitions extended to the nonbinary domain, ensemble enumerators of codewords, trapping sets, stopping sets, and pseudocodewords are calculated. The exact enumerators are presented in the finite-length regime, and the corresponding growth rates are calculated in the asymptotic regime. An EXIT chart tool for computing the iterative decoding thresholds of protograph-based LDPC codes is presented, followed by several examples of finite-length U-NBPB and C-NBPB codes with high performance. Throughout this paper, we provide accompanying examples, which demonstrate the advantage of nonbinary protograph-based LDPC codes over their binary counterparts and over random constructions. The results presented in this paper advance the analytical toolbox of nonbinary graph-based codes.},

With this low complexity algorithm, we are able to decode GF(2/sup q/) LDPC codes up to a field order value of 256. We show by simulation that ultra-sparse regular LDPC codes in GF(64) and GF(256) exhibit very good performance.},

This paper attempts to survey the state of the art in this area and identifies some issues which need to be addressed. We have identified the five key steps in ASIP design as application analysis, architectural design space exploration, instruction set generation, code synthesis and hardware synthesis. A broad classification of the approaches reported in the literature is done. The paper notes the need to broaden the architectural space being explored and to tightly couple the various subtasks in ASIP synthesis.},
